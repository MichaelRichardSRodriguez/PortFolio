# PortFolio
A personal web portfolio built with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, created in Visual Studio. The responsive design showcases my skills and projects, using Bootstrap for a mobile-first approach and custom CSS for styling. This portfolio demonstrates my proficiency in front-end web development and design.
